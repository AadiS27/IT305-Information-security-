## 🎤 Presentation Script (5 minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Good morning! Today I'm presenting our Week 1 progress on the 'Intelligent Biometric Cryptographic Vault' - a cutting-edge security system that combines face recognition with advanced machine learning and cryptographic protection."

### Problem Statement (1 minute)
"Traditional password-based systems are increasingly vulnerable. With 81% of data breaches involving compromised passwords, we need multi-factor authentication. Our solution addresses three key challenges:
1. **Weak Authentication**: Passwords can be stolen or guessed
2. **Single Point of Failure**: One compromised credential = full access
3. **Poor User Experience**: Complex passwords are hard to remember"

### Solution Overview (1.5 minutes)
"Our innovative approach combines:
- **Biometric Authentication**: Face recognition for unique user identification
- **Ensemble Machine Learning**: Three algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Network) working together for 95%+ accuracy
- **Military-Grade Encryption**: SHA-256 hashing with AES encryption for file protection
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-3-second authentication"

### Technical Innovation (1.5 minutes)
"What makes our system unique:
1. **Ensemble Learning**: Instead of relying on one algorithm, we use three ML models that vote on authentication decisions
2. **Adaptive Thresholds**: System learns and adjusts to improve accuracy over time
3. **Cryptographic Integration**: Seamless file encryption tied to biometric verification
4. **Persistence**: Models and user data survive system restarts"

### Next Steps (30 seconds)
"Week 2 focuses on implementing core face detection and basic authentication. Our timeline ensures steady progress toward a fully functional system by midsem evaluation."

### Q&A Preparation
**Expected Questions:**
- Q: "Why face recognition over fingerprint?"
- A: "Non-contact, works with existing cameras, harder to forge than fingerprints"

- Q: "What about privacy concerns?"
- A: "Face encodings are mathematical representations, not actual images. Plus local storage ensures data control"

- Q: "How do you handle false positives?"
- A: "Ensemble voting and adjustable thresholds minimize false accepts while maintaining usability"
