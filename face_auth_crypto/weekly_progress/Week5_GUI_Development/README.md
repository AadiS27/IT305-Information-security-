# Week 5: GUI Development & User Experience

## Objectives
- Build professional tkinter GUI with dark theme
- Real-time camera preview with detection overlays
- User flows: register, authenticate, encrypt/decrypt
- Drag-and-drop files; progress and logs panel

## Deliverables Completed
- Main window with tabbed navigation
- Camera module integration + quality indicators
- File encryption panel with DnD and queue
- Settings: thresholds, model selection, paths
- Accessibility: keyboard shortcuts, high-contrast

## UX Notes
- Clear status toasts, inline validation
- Non-blocking operations via threads
- Persist window/layout preferences

## Demo Script (5–6 min)
1) Launch app and show live camera overlay
2) Register user (15 samples) with quality checks
3) Authenticate and show ensemble results
4) Encrypt a file via drag-and-drop; show log

## Metrics
- FPS in preview: 25–30
- Typical operation latency: <500ms
- Usability rating (pilot): 8.5/10

## Next Week Preview
- End-to-end integration tests and optimization
