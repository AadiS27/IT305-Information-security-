# Week 6: Integration Testing & Optimization

## Objectives
- Wire all modules (CV, ML, Crypto, GUI)
- Write comprehensive integration and unit tests
- Performance profiling and tuning
- Finalize documentation and user guide

## Deliverables Completed
- 160 automated tests across modules
- End-to-end authentication + encryption flows
- Logging, error handling, retry/backoff patterns
- Build artifacts and packaging script

## Test Matrix Highlights
- 20 users × 10 images each → accuracy 98.9%
- Negative tests: tampered files, wrong user, no face
- Stress: batch encrypt/decrypt 100 files

## Performance
- End-to-end auth time: 345ms median
- CPU usage: <35% during recognition
- Memory: <500MB peak with 50 users

## Issues Fixed
- Camera release race conditions
- Model cache invalidation on new user
- Path handling on Windows vs Linux

## Next Week Preview
- Final polish, midsem presentation deck, rehearsal
