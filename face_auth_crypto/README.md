### 2. Register Your First User
1. Choose option **1** (Register new user)
2. Enter a username
3. Position your face in front of the camera
4. Capture 20-30 face samples for best accuracy
5. Press 'c' to capture each sample

### 3. Train the Models
1. Choose option **3** (Train recognition models)
2. Wait for training to complete (may take a few minutes)
3. Review the accuracy scores displayed

### 4. Authenticate and Use
1. Choose option **2** (Authenticate user)
2. Position your face in front of the camera
3. Press SPACE when ready
4. Once authenticated, you can encrypt/decrypt files

## Usage Examples

### File Encryption
```
1. Authenticate with your face
2. Choose option 4 (Encrypt file)
3. Enter the path to your file
4. Choose encryption type:
   - Standard encryption (password-based)
   - Face-authenticated encryption (requires face auth to decrypt)
```

### File Decryption
```
1. Authenticate with your face
2. Choose option 5 (Decrypt file)
3. Enter the path to encrypted file
4. System automatically detects encryption type and decrypts
```

### Folder Operations
```
- Option 6: Encrypt entire folder
- Option 7: Decrypt entire folder
```

## Configuration

### Recognition Threshold
- **Default**: 0.6
- **Lower values**: More lenient (may allow wrong users)
- **Higher values**: More strict (may reject correct users)
- **Adjust**: Use option 9 (Adjust settings) in the main menu

### Model Parameters
- **SVM**: RBF kernel with probability estimation
- **Random Forest**: 100 estimators
- **Neural Network**: 128-64 hidden layers with early stopping
- **Face Encoding**: 128-dimensional face vectors

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices
1. **Use good lighting** when capturing face samples
2. **Capture samples from different angles** for better recognition
3. **Keep your crypto.key file secure** - this encrypts your files
4. **Regularly retrain models** when adding new users
5. **Use face-authenticated encryption** for highly sensitive files

### Security Features
- **AES-256 encryption** for all file operations
- **Secure random key generation** using cryptography library
- **Face encoding privacy** - only mathematical representations stored
- **Session timeout** and secure logout
- **Audit logging** for all operations

### Limitations
- **Lighting sensitivity**: Poor lighting affects recognition accuracy
- **Hardware dependency**: Requires working camera
- **Single face per authentication**: Currently supports one face at a time
- **Storage**: Face samples require disk space

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Working
```
Error: Could not open camera
Solution: 
- Check if camera is connected and working
- Close other applications using the camera
- Try running: python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.VideoCapture(0).isOpened())"
```

#### Low Recognition Accuracy
```
Problem: System not recognizing your face
Solutions:
1. Capture more training samples (30-50)
2. Ensure good lighting during capture and authentication
3. Lower the recognition threshold in settings
4. Retrain models after adding more samples
```

#### Installation Errors
```
Error: Package installation failed
Solutions:
1. Update pip: python -m pip install --upgrade pip
2. Install Visual C++ Build Tools (Windows)
3. Use conda instead of pip for some packages
4. Try installing packages individually
```

#### Import Errors
```
Error: Module not found
Solutions:
1. Ensure virtual environment is activated
2. Reinstall dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Check Python version compatibility
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Better Accuracy
- Capture 30-50 face samples per user
- Use consistent lighting conditions
- Include samples with slight variations (glasses, no glasses, etc.)
- Retrain models regularly

#### For Faster Processing
- Reduce image resolution for faster capture
- Use SVM or Random Forest instead of Neural Network
- Limit cross-validation folds for large datasets

## Advanced Features

### Batch Operations
```python
# Example: Encrypt multiple files
for file in file_list:
    crypto_manager.encrypt_file(file)
```

### Custom Thresholds per User
```python
# Set different thresholds for different users
recognizer.set_user_threshold("user1", 0.7)
recognizer.set_user_threshold("user2", 0.5)
```

### Integration with Other Systems
The system is designed to be modular and can be integrated with:
- Web applications (Flask/Django)
- Desktop applications (Tkinter/PyQt)
- IoT devices
- Cloud storage systems
